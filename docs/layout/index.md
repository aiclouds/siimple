Our **layout** module is an easy-to-use collection of components that lets you create the skeleton of your website/app. It provides fundamental features every framework should offer (a navbar, a tab system, etc.) to make easier and faster the first steps of your project: a little bit of previous experience with HTML and CSS is all you need to be capable of using this module effectively.

Before beginning, there's a detail we have to talk about: the layout **sizes**. There are several components here in **siimple layout** whose sizes can be customized depending on what you're looking for.

There are 6 different sizes:

| Size | Pixes | Syntax | 
| **Extra small** | `480px` | `siimple-{component}--extra-small` |
| **Small** | `600px` | `siimple-{component}--small` |
| **Medium** | `768px` | `siimple-{component}--medium` |
| **Large** | `960px` | `siimple-{component}--large` |
| **Extra large** | `1280px` | `siimple-{component}--extra-large` |
| **Fluid** | `100% - 20px` | `siimple-{component}--fluid` |
