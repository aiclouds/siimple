## Installation

The **siimple** package is available on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/siimple), so you can run the following command to add it to your project: 

```bash
$ npm install --save siimple
``` 

This package is also available on a [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/siimple), so you can import the compiled CSS files directly on your HTML page. 


## Usage

You can include the compiled styles in your HTML files: 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/siimple/dist/siimple.min.css">
```

The source files are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), so you can import all the styles in your scss files: 

```scss
@use "siimple";
```

Make sure that you have added your `node_modules` folder to your Sass [include paths](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths).
